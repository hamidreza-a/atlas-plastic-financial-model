# Atlas Plastic Ltd — Financial Model

This repository contains a fully integrated Excel financial model for **Atlas Plastic Ltd** (a **fictional** plastic packaging manufacturer).  
The model is designed as a portfolio-style sample to demonstrate end-to-end financial modeling skills: forecasting, financial statements, valuation, and scenario/sensitivity analysis.

## What’s Included
- **3-statement model** (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) with full integration
- **Driver-based forecasting** (revenue, margins, working capital, capex, debt)
- **Scenario / sensitivity analysis** (base / downside / upside or key driver tables)
- **Checks & balances** (consistency tests such as balance sheet balance, cash reconciliation)


## Modeling Standards Used
- Separation of **inputs → calculations → outputs**
- Clear driver-based logic and consistent timelines
- Built-in checks (e.g., balance sheet balancing, cash flow tie-out)
- Conservative, audit-friendly formulas (minimal hard-coding in calculation areas)

## Color Coding Convention

The model follows a consistent color-coding standard to improve transparency and usability:

- **Blue cells**: hard-coded inputs and assumptions  
- **Green cells**: values referenced from other worksheets (cross-sheet links)  
- **Black cells**: formula-driven calculations


## Skills Demonstrated
- Financial statement forecasting (3-statement integration)
- Working capital and cash flow mechanics
- Debt schedule modeling
- Valuation and sensitivity analysis
- Excel structuring, documentation, and error checks
